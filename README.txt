This project uses the attached .csv file. The main purpose of this project is to compare the combinations of different techniques of handling NULL values and normalization methods. 
This comparison is done by comparing accuracy after fitting the data on a decision tree. We see that replacing null values with the mean values followed by min-max normalization 
gave the best accuracy. Please have a look at the notebook for the data description. The notebook has the following main headers-
